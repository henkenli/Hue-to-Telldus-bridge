Hue-to-Telldus-bridge
=====================

A bridge for mapping and transfer of 433 MHz RF remote control transmitters to Philips Hue system.

There is no good wallswitches for Philips Hue and the system thinking is limited to one persons use of a smartphone to control the lights. When one person leaves the house, all lights can go out. Not a working solution for a household.

We are planning to use Philips Hue for the whole house beginning with the studios and the kitchen.

These Hue bulbs are the first lightning solution that allows us to get the right color temperature for the right moments and working conditions.

The new kitchen does not have to have colored accents, only white in different shades and then Hue bulbs setting the scene. Hue bulbs also give the right work light in the studio. Before it was not possible to see some shades when working with fine craftmanship or delicate electronics. 

The idea is to use available componenents like Tellstick Duo or Tellstick Net from Telldus Technologies and an Arduino or RaspberryPi to map wireless wall transmitters like Nexa WT-1 or WT-2.

An dual wall switch equals four buttons, one off and three for three fixed lightning scenes. Or one off and one to toggle between different lightning scenes and two to change brightness etc.

The new bridge will have a table linking switch pressings to one or more lightning scenes already defined in the Philips Hue bridge. These scenes will be defined and changed with the standard method of a computer or a smartphone.

Goal:

- Each room in the house may have a wallswitch(es) for local control of the light setting.
- There shall also be wallswithes for setting global light settings for the whole house while leaving or coming home, for evening, night, day, going to bed etc.
- The many possibilities within Philips Hue command set shall be possible to address in a smooth manner and integration with IFTTT etc shall be as seamless as possible.
- If it is possible to use Philips Living Colours and Living Whites remotes to add functionality, it is good.
